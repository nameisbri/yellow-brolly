      {
        question: 'How much does technology consulting cost?',
        answer:
          'We offer project-based pricing tailored to your scope and stage. Typical investments start at $X,XXX for assessments and digital readiness audits, with full implementations ranging based on complexity, team size, and timeline. We\'ll provide a detailed proposal after understanding your specific needs.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What\'s a digital readiness assessment?',
        answer:
          'A digital readiness assessment is a comprehensive evaluation of your current technology stack, team capacity, and cultural readiness for change. We review your tools, processes, security posture, and team adoption rates to create a clear picture of where you are and where you need to go. Typical timeline: 2-4 weeks.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How long does a tech stack audit take?',
        answer:
          'A comprehensive tech stack audit typically takes 2-4 weeks. This includes stakeholder interviews, tool inventory, usage analysis, security review, and documentation. We deliver an executive-ready report with prioritized recommendations and a roadmap for implementation.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Do we need to be technical to work with you?',
        answer:
          'Not at all. We specialize in working with non-technical leaders who need technology to work for their teams. We translate technical concepts into clear, actionable strategies. Our goal is to make technology accessible, not intimidating.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What\'s the difference between a CTO and a technology consultant?',
        answer:
          'A CTO is a full-time executive role focused on long-term technology strategy and team management. A technology consultant (like us) provides strategic guidance, implementation support, and expertise on a project basis. We help you build the right systems and processes, then hand them over to your team. Many organizations work with us to establish their tech foundation before hiring a full-time CTO.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can you help us if we\'re just starting out?',
        answer:
          'Absolutely. We specialize in helping organizations at every stage—from bootstrapping startups to scaling nonprofits. Early-stage work often focuses on selecting the right foundational tools and establishing good practices from the start, which saves significant time and money later.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What if we already have tools in place?',
        answer:
          'Most of our clients come to us with existing tools. We help you audit what you have, identify gaps and redundancies, and create a plan to optimize your current stack. Sometimes the solution is better adoption of existing tools, not new ones.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you only work with nonprofits?',
        answer:
          'While we have deep expertise with nonprofits and mission-driven organizations, we also work with creative agencies, tech startups, and other people-first organizations. What unites our clients is a commitment to culture and values, not just profit.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle cybersecurity?',
        answer:
          'Security is built into everything we do, not added as an afterthought. We conduct comprehensive security audits, develop policies and protocols, provide training, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.). We believe security should be practical and accessible, not overwhelming.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens after a project ends?',
        answer:
          'We provide comprehensive documentation and training so your team can maintain what we\'ve built. Many clients choose ongoing support for optimization, new integrations, or strategic guidance. We also offer quarterly check-ins and "Amplify" phase support for organizations that want continuous improvement.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can you help with AI adoption?',
        answer:
          'Yes, but we\'re thoughtful about it. We help you assess whether AI actually solves your problems (sometimes a spreadsheet is better). When AI makes sense, we help you integrate it thoughtfully, train your team, and measure real impact—not just hype.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What makes YellowBrolly different from other consultants?',
        answer:
          'We focus on the intersection of technology and culture. We don\'t just recommend tools—we ensure they fit how your team actually works. Our PMC (People Matter Culture) approach means we care about your values, not just your efficiency. Plus, we\'re built for teams of 10-100, not 10,000, so you get personalized attention without enterprise bloat.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How do we get started?',
        answer:
          'Start with a discovery call. We\'ll discuss your challenges, goals, and current state. If there\'s a good fit, we\'ll propose a scope of work tailored to your needs. No pressure, no hard sell—just honest conversation about whether we can help.',
